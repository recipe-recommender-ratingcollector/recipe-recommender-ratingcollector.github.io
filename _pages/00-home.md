The Recipe Recommender uses two different recommendation algorithms to, based upon ratings you provide for some recipes,
get to know your taste and recommend meals for you that suit both your taste and your nutrition requirements.  
For this to work, I need a foundation of ratings for all recipes in the recipe database I created, and for that, I 
need your help.  
<br>
If you are here to just help as much as possible, simply follow [this link](https://temporary-server.de/get_initial_ratings_start)
to get started, and rate as many recipes 
as you can / want.   

If you are a Cognitive Science Student from Uni Osnabr√ºck and want to get up to 1 VP / "Versuchspersonenstunde", read 
[the guide for getting VPs for this](/vp-guide).

**Thanks a lot for your help!**
