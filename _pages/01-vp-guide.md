In order to get 0.5 VPs, you need to rate 15 recipes.   
To get 1 VP, rate 30 recipes.   
You can of course rate even more, each rating is a huge help, but I sadly cannot offer more than 1 VP.

At the bottom of the start-page (link is at the end of this guide), you find your ID that is associated with your ratings (see image below).  
Please note down this ID! It would be best if you could take a screenshot of the page where you see your ID, 
but if that is for some reason not possible for you, that's fine as well.

Please also note down / count how many recipes you already rated!    

When you're done with rating recipes, [email me](mailto:per@starke-team.de) with your
* Full name
* Matriculation number
* ID that you noted down (Append the screenshot, if possible)
* Number of recipes that you rated / if you get 0.5 or 1 VP.

If you don't want to rate all recipes at once, but take a break in between, that is no problem.  
You can just close the page and start again later. You will get a new ID in that case, just tell me that ID as well,
so that I can track / check how many recipes you have rated


That is everything you need to know! To get started, follow [this link](http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_initial_ratings_start).
